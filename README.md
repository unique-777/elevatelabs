TASK 1:
hey all!iam jahnavi.in this task i have completed data preprocessing,data scaling,outlier detection and correction along with handling null and missing values in titanic dataset as a part of task 1 by elevate labs.I have completed this task on my own but just some corrections using my old datascience and ml projects.but i want to complete this in depth by next task like a pro.here i have just followed hints and completed it.
TASK 2:
In this task, I have identified patterns, trends, and anomalies in the dataset using visualizations like histograms using pairplot which came under statistical measures, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps. These visuals helped make basic feature-level inferences, such as spotting outliers, understanding feature distributions, and recognizing strong correlations between variables.
TASK 3:
I have  implemented both simple and multiple linear regression using the house sales dataset. preprocessed the data, split it into training and testing sets, and trained a LinearRegression model from scikit-learn & evaluated model performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R², and visualized results with histograms of feature coefficients, and regression line plots to understand feature–price relationships along with created pairplot for all these features in data.
