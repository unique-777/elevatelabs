TASK 2:
In this task, we identified patterns, trends, and anomalies in the dataset using visualizations like histograms using pairplot which came under statistical measures, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps. These visuals helped make basic feature-level inferences, such as spotting outliers, understanding feature distributions, and recognizing strong correlations between variables.
